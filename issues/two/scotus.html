                            <p><i>Disclaimer: I fully recognize the mistakes and hypocrisy of both political parties in
                                    the context of their attitudes towards SCOTUS, but for this article I will be
                                    focusing on one side of the equation, as I believe it isn’t getting enough coverage
                                    or consideration. I also want to emphasize that a) when I write “Democrats” or
                                    “Republicans,” I’m referring to the party as an institution, not its individual
                                    constituents, and b) my intention is not to articulate any verdict of merit on any
                                    justices I mention, but to analyze and critique the political environment
                                    surrounding their nominations and terms. </i>
                            </p>

                            <p>With just over a month before the most critical election in American history, the death
                                of Ruth Bader Ginsberg has thrown more kerosene onto an already raging inferno of
                                political mayhem and ill-will. Reportedly, RBG’s dying wish was that she be replaced
                                after the next election. However, the constitution clearly provides the president with
                                the right and duty to install justices without regard to when during their term, and all
                                the presidents with the opportunity to nominate a justice in the final year of their
                                term did so. Half of the country rejecting this fundamental element of American
                                government is telling of a more endemic, insidious issue: the Democratic Party has come
                                to view SCOTUS as a guaranteed vehicle of their ideologies and policies, not as an
                                apolitical body to evaluate cases within themselves with the purpose of enacting justice
                                and adhering to the law.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="important">1. A History of the Democratically-skewed SCOTUS</p>

                            <p>Where along the line did Democrats claim SCOTUS as their own, as opposed to the people’s?
                                As early as 1933, FDR appointed 8 out of the 9 justices to the Supreme Court in what is
                                commonly referred to “packing the court,” brazenly claiming the SCOTUS as their own.
                                With this crooked arrangement, FDR attempted to force New Deal legislation that
                                radically expanded the government’s power over the economy. Although this strategy
                                largely failed, the fact that it was considered and implemented in the first place
                                indicates a willingness to sabotage the apolitical nature of the court for party
                                interests.

                            </p>

                            <p>Since 1933 Democrats have controlled the Senate for 71 years, while the Republicans have
                                for only 16. In effect, the vast majority of Republican nominations had to be acceptable
                                to a Democrat senate than vice versa. As you can imagine, nominations in a split
                                government (where the Senate and President are of opposing parties), have a much lower
                                likelihood of being confirmed than when the Senate and President share a party (united
                                government): of the 30 successful confirmations since 1945, only 13 occurred in a split
                                government- all of which occurred with Republican presidents and Democratic Senates. In
                                every instance since 1945 when the government is united, presidential justice
                                nominations have been confirmed.

                            </p>

                            <p>This asymmetry has allowed the constitution has been eroded to accommodate a generally
                                progressive agenda over the past several decade, passing a slew of overtly liberal cases
                                with dubitable legal founding- facilitating gerrymandering to favor urban areas at the
                                expense of rural districts in 1962 (Democratic voters live in urban areas at higher
                                rates while Republicans tend to live in rural regions), designating abortion as a
                                woman’s right in Roe V Wade at a time when national support for it was at a mere 21%,
                                upholding the Affordable Care Act’s despite its questionable individual mandate, and
                                leaving DACA untouched despite its allowing the executive branch to bypass Congress’
                                legal restrictions immigrant status and benefits- just to name a few.

                            </p>

                            <p>Furthermore, almost all justices shift to the left over time, Republican nominees at a
                                greater rate than Democrats, ending their terms with the same Martin-Quinn score
                                (leftness to rightness). In the 2018 term, despite liberals having a 4-5 minority, they
                                won the same proportion of cases, indicating that “conservative” judges sided with
                                liberals frequently, while liberals have voted along ideological lines essentially all
                                the time as shown by their voting records.

                            </p>

                            <p class="important">2. An Escalation of Vitriolic Partisanship
                            </p>

                            <p>But it was really in 1987 when caustic slander and hysteria following Supreme Court
                                nominations became tragically and jarringly normalized. Despite Democrats forming a
                                “phalanx” to oppose any non-liberal judge, Reagan nominated Robert Bork, widely regarded
                                as the most qualified nominee of the century and champion of originalism, the practice
                                of adhering to only the written words of the Constitution rather than hypothesizing
                                about it as a living document.

                            </p>

                            <p>With Joe Biden leading the Judiciary Committee in a Democrat majority Senate, Senator Ted
                                Kennedy publicly assaulted Bork before the hearing even occurred, claiming that Bork’s
                                installment would result in an America in which “blacks would sit at segregated lunch
                                counters.” This is an outright lie- Bork explicitly condemned segregation as an
                                overreach of government power to dictate people’s personal lives and associations- and
                                argued that state-mandated integration is the other side of the same coin. His stance
                                had everything to do with individual liberty and nothing to do with race. As Solicitor
                                General, Bork consistently enforced minorities’ rights by siding with liberal positions
                                as often as Thurgood Marshall (generally regarded as one of the most liberal justices of
                                all time). Although Bork’s course of reasoning may be questionable today, Kennedy’s
                                attack invoking racism was visceral and unfounded. Biden charged Bork with supporting
                                police raids on couples who used contraceptives and an enemy to the right of privacy and
                                individual freedom, based on Bork’s interpretation that the constitution lacked explicit
                                provision for such a right to privacy. Senator Metzenabum took it further, accusing Bork
                                of promoting sterilization and sexism. Throughout the entire hearing, Bork’s nuanced,
                                constitutionally and legally founded positions were intentionally twisted and
                                hyperbolized.

                            </p>

                            <p>The appalling mudslinging at the arguably the most qualified man of the century was
                                called a “lynching” and “frankensteining” by headlines across the country, cementing the
                                word “bork” as a verb: to savage someone to prevent them from being appointed. Feminist
                                Florynce Kennedy used it in reference to the highly astute and reputable Clarence
                                Thomas’ nomination (by G. W. Bush) to the Supreme Court: “We're going to bork him. We're
                                going to kill him politically ... This little creep, where did he come from?" Thomas was
                                bombarded with unsubstantiated and largely refuted sexual assault allegations, as well
                                as slammed for his legitimate criticisms of affirmative action (which I can detail in a
                                later article), and his lack of definitive opinion on Roe v. Wade, both issues which are
                                distinctly partisan and constitutionally questionable. Thomas blames at least part of
                                the vigor of defamation against him to the identity politics his being black entails:
                                “People should just tell the truth: 'This is the wrong black guy; he has to be
                                destroyed.'...If you criticize a black person who’s more liberal, you’re a racist.
                                Whereas you can do whatever to me...that’s fine because you’re not really black because
                                you’re not doing what we expect black people to do.”

                            </p>

                            <p>In 2018, when Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, a sexual assault
                                allegations conveniently materialized, a low tactic that attempted to assert a moral
                                highground. Testimonies were flaky at best; investigations yielded nothing. According to
                                the New York Times, the Democrats painted Kavanaugh as “archconservative who would roll
                                back abortion rights, undo health care protections, ease gun restrictions and protect
                                President Trump against the threat of indictment.” In fact, Kavanaugh voted along
                                relatively conservative and liberal judges at equal frequencies- in contrast to
                                Democrat-nominated judges, who have stood their ideological ground 100% of the time, as
                                their voting records show. He split from Trump multiple times- rejecting cases seeking
                                to block Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding, imposing a restriction on Apple in an
                                antitrust case, and denying Trump’s cause to add a citizenship question on the census.

                            </p>

                            <p>It appears that the Democratic Party refuses to look at the logistics of voting records
                                and constitutionality. In Senator Schumer’s words: “the most important criteria for
                                choosing a judge are their judicial philosophy and ideology.” It happened for Justice
                                Alito, who was accused of prejudice against minorities and women based on misconstrued
                                interpretations of Alito’s records from his 20s. It happened for Justice Roberts, who
                                the Democrats attempted to enact a filibuster against for following in Scalia’s
                                constitutional footsteps. It happened for Justice O’ Connor, for whom liberal pundits
                                called on Democrat Senors to oppose due to her personal preference against abortion,
                                despite her overt consistency in evaluating a case by itself, not by her personal
                                beliefs.

                                install a new justice, accusing him of attempting to seize power in an autocratic
                                fashion. But since 1888, there have been 29 Supreme Court nominations- 10 of which
                                occurred when the executive and legislative branches were led by different parties- made
                                in the last couple of months of a president’s term, including those made during lame
                                duck sessions (December) between the election and installation of a new president. In
                                the history of the United States, the president has always nominated to fill an empty
                                seat and thus done their part in fulfilling their constitutional duty. The Senate, which
                                is elected by the people, then decides if this nomination passes through. Even RBG
                                publicly stated in 2016 that it’s the president’s constitutional responsibility to
                                nominate and the Senate to move forward with confirmation.

                            </p>

                            <p>It seems that the Democratic Party can’t abide by this simple, fundamental rule and are
                                fully willing to enact judicial instability to further their own interests. In 2013,
                                Harry Reid, the former Democratic majority leader, caved to pressure from liberal
                                judicial groups and abolished the nominee filibuster in order to allow Obama appointees
                                in lower courts to pass through. This allowed a mere majority, as opposed to ⅔, of
                                senators, to change senate rules- it now takes 51, instead of 60, votes to proceed on a
                                nomination for a circuit court judge. At the time, there were hundreds of judicial
                                vacancies at the federal level because nobody was able to acquire 60 votes from a
                                politicized Senate since George Bush- so with the rule change, McConnell played dirty
                                partisanship too and filled them all with Trump appointees. Later, with Trump’s
                                nomination of Neil Gorusch, Republicans took a page out of the Democrat playbook and
                                elevated the nuclear option to apply to SCOTUS and federal courts as well.

                            </p>

                            <p>In the days following RBG’s death, Democratic congressmen took to the Congress floor by
                                storm. Ro Khanna of CA proposed a bill mandating 18 year term limits and limiting
                                nominations to the first and third years of a president’s term. Chuck Shumer and AOC are
                                leading a coalition that’s openly considering court-packing- “nothing is off the table.”
                                These initiatives and effectively undermining all precedent for how the Supreme Court
                                functions- along the vein of “if it doesn’t serve us, destroy it.”

                            </p>

                            <p>Christopher Kang, a progressive leader aimed at altering SCOTUS, claims that “what we're
                                seeing over the last couple of days is the increasing realization that Republicans are
                                going to exercise as much raw political power as they can to ensure that the Supreme
                                Court remains a partisan institution.” This is peak hypocrisy, as I previously detailed-
                                Democratic nominees have dominated the courts for over ⅘ of the time since 1933, with a
                                relatively conservative majority only taking shape in 2018 and not even consistently
                                voting along that characterization. Although unlikely to actually occur, these
                                initiatives ooze a flawed, inexcusably privileged belief that the SCOTUS seats belong to
                                the Democratic Party.

                            </p>

                            <p>The seats of the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately belong to the American
                                electorate, who votes in the president and Senate, who in turn designate appointees.
                                Over the course of eighty years, the Democratic party has become accustomed to the
                                courts enacting their will by their hold on the Senate and challenging the Constitution,
                                and over the past thirty years, have escalated the partisanship and animus of SCOTUS
                                nominees. This makes for a dysfunctional Court, weighed down by increasingly fervent
                                ideological demands- those who expect their legacy of getting their way to continue, and
                                those who want their lost ground and time compensated in any means possible.
