                            <p>Hypocritically, the rich are seen as both the root of all of America’s problems, as well
                                as a panacea. It is true that there is significant wealth inequality in the United
                                States, but it seems that the most vocalized response to this is to blame the
                                successful, instead of looking inwards to see what each individual can do for themselves
                                first, or perhaps learn from those who have “made it.” Both liberal and conservative
                                think tanks (Brookings Institute and the Heritage Foundation) agree that the three major
                                indicators of future individual financial stability and overall well-being are
                                ultimately determined by an individual’s choices: finish high school, get a full-time
                                job, and wait until age 21 to get married and have children.
                            </p>

                            <p>Still, the idea of a wealth or corporation tax is increasingly supported, as the most
                                direct policy initiative to manifest the externalization of blame. I won’t spend this
                                article delving into the cultural erosion, the tolerance of the abdication of personal
                                responsibility, that a wealth tax’s popularity seems indicative of. Instead, I will
                                present direct evidence to logically prove why wealth taxes will most likely fail, from
                                a purely economic standpoint.
                            </p>

                            <p>As usual, Western Europe is a decent place to look where America can evaluate the success
                                (or lack thereof) of “progressive” policies. Of the 12 European countries that had
                                wealth taxes in 1990, only 3 have not repealed it, and Belgium recently introduced a
                                limited version which has yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Across the board, there
                                was an exodus of wealthy individuals from the country, at the country’s expense. In
                                Sweden, one of the most heavily taxed populations in the world (the top tax bracket is
                                taxed 63%, and taxes are levied from both the state/canton and city level and includes
                                almost all assets, from securities to jewelry) the tax caused approximately 1.5 trillion
                                krona of capital flight (which is a historical precursor to economic depression which
                                incurs reduced purchasing power for remaining civilians and unstable prices) while it
                                was imposed. This raised concern from central, moderate, and liberal parties and
                                representatives about potentially losing Sweden’s competitiveness in the global economy.
                                It’s also been blamed for Sweden’s lagging in entrepreneurship compared to the rest of
                                Europe. In France, an estimated 42,000 millionaires left the country between 2010 and
                                2012 when the tax was imposed, taking about $175 billion worth of assets with them. In
                                addition, 400,000 jobs were lost, and unemployment increased by 2% while the wealth tax
                                was imposed. Without dramatic expansion of government oversight and management of
                                private wealth, wealth taxes in Europe failed dramatically to raise revenue and instead
                                drained participating countries of economic strength.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here’s why America wouldn’t be an exception to this pattern of wealth taxes bringing
                                economic ruin.
                            </p>

                            <p>To clarify, a wealth tax differs from current US taxes, in what is being taxed: in
                                America, individuals are mainly taxed for their income earned from their jobs and
                                investments. A wealth tax would be annually charged based on an individual's assets,
                                which includes their stocks, home, cars, and art- essentially, everything someone owns-
                                in addition to already existing income taxes. Obviously, this is attractive to
                                proponents of wealth-distribution because it takes from a much larger range of
                                money-making or valuable things that the rich possess.
                            </p>

                            <p>Does it sound easy or even feasible for a government to track and tax every single
                                possession of the rich, the most well-versed in financial policy? Just from a logistical
                                standpoint, such a tax would be difficult to enforce since most assets are illiquid, so
                                they wouldn’t be able to have their value quantified. The majority of net worth held by
                                billionaires that politicians point towards to demonstrate exorbitant wealth are tied in
                                stocks and are not simply cash in a pile somewhere. In Europe, the biggest problem in
                                administering the wealth tax was valuing assets, and according to Wojciech Kopczuk at
                                Columbia University, such problems “are as daunting in the United States as in Europe.”
                                For example, 10 years ago IRS researchers compared estate tax returns with Forbes’
                                published calculations, and found discrepancies by a factor of two. This is illustrated
                                by estate taxes in America, which are calculated only once during or after a lifetime
                                under extremely specific policies, but are still notoriously difficult and expensive.
                                Wealth taxes would require this process, for every asset, for every individual, every
                                year.
                            </p>

                            <p>Any extra revenue is often offset by administrative costs because of how difficult it is
                                to put a number for the value of what the rich own. Although some may argue that the
                                majority of the wealth of the top .001% is in listed securities with clear, market-based
                                value, any investor knows that these prices can vary greatly. Assets like racehorses,
                                antiques, and houses can take years to evaluate as auditors and tax authorities
                                disagree. Case in point: Austria cited administrative costs in 1994, the year it
                                abolished its wealth tax.4
                            </p>


                            <p>In addition to a disparaging lack of feasibility, wealth taxes would simply drive away
                                the wealth to be taxed, reducing overall participation in, and health of, the economy.
                                Looking at Europe again, their significant wealth taxes, levied more along the top 5%
                                instead of the top 1% as the chant often goes in America, did not raise much money: as
                                little as 0.2% of the GDP per year. The tax reeled in about $600 million a year in
                                Sweden, but ultimately cost the country’s economy about $200 billion in capital flight.
                                In France, Éric Pichet, a professor at the Kedge business school in France, estimates
                                that the wealth tax had raised 3.6 billion euros a year, and robbed the national economy
                                (the value of the assets and transactions of every civilian and corporation) of almost
                                double the wealth tax’s revenue–€7 billion annually–in fraud and shrinking of the tax
                                base. In the first 10 years of France’s tax, Pichet estimates that France lost about 200
                                billion euros of capital through a population exodus or a lack of investment, because
                                entrepreneurs protected their wealth in accounts that were taxed less under other
                                jurisdictions. In Germany, where assets weren’t taxed equally, they moved their
                                investments out of stocks and bonds, which were taxed more, and funnelled more money
                                into property, which was officially taxed much lower than the market rate. Predictably,
                                investments moved back into securities after the tax was repealed. By turning wealth
                                into a source of loss, wealth is inevitably protected by its proprietors by keeping it
                                out of the country’s economy. Less value in the economy means lower wages and
                                unemployment for all, reduced production of consumption (for the civilians) and capital
                                goods (for businesses to invest in production with), investment in entrepreneurship and
                                innovation, and could trigger widespread economic withdrawal.
                            </p>


                            <p>Furthermore, the vast majority of the rich don’t store most of their wealth in the form
                                of consumer goods like mansions or expensive cars that sit there and do nothing for
                                anyone else, but on the contrary: in the form of business and capital assets that
                                produce economic growth. Take Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos, or any of the common targets of
                                a wealth tax that people say “shouldn’t exist” for their monetary success. Musk is the
                                largest investor in Tesla, owning about 22% of shares, and owns 54% of SpaceX. Bezos
                                owns 11.2% of Amazon (including over 40 subsidiaries such as Audible, Twitch, Whole
                                Foods which provide entertainment and goods to millions) as well as having invested
                                millions into Uber, Airbnb, and the Washington Post. Mark Zuckerberg pledged 99% of the
                                value of the stocks that he and his wife own to be donated over their lifetimes to other
                                companies focused on modernizing education and science. These are just a few examples of
                                how the rich dedicate much of their assets to ventures focused on collective
                                advancement: producing and innovating technology and entertainment, distributing
                                essential goods and journalism, improving education, and providing employment for
                                hundreds of thousands of people. Weakening an entrepreneur’s ownership of their
                                companies would detract both from the success of the company, and therefore the wealth
                                made from it, which fuels these “paying it forward” ventures that everyone could benefit
                                from. Wealth taxes would only disrupt the accumulation of capital, detracting from
                                investments that would provide capital for innovators and producers—and for workers to
                                work receive-- and be a deadweight loss for all Americans.

                            <p>Here in America, California refuses to learn from Europe and is already recreating their
                                mistakes. As the state with the highest income taxes in America, they still continue to
                                propose and implement tax hikes: Two bills proposed over the summer of 2020, AB 2088 and
                                AB 1253, would increase taxes for the top .15% of earners, as well as a .4% wealth tax
                                on those with a net worth above $30 million- which would even apply to residents for 10
                                years after they leave the state, and would raise the taxes on higher-income earner from
                                13.3% to as much as 16.8% (respectively). Elon Musk has threatened to move Tesla’s
                                headquarters out of California, while the clients of many high-level accounting and
                                consulting companies are increasingly indicating an impetus to leave the state, as
                                COVID19 has made them realize that it makes no sense to stay in such a highly taxed area
                                when they could work remotely from anywhere. In response to 2012 tax hikes in California
                                by 3% for high income households, the exodus of top-bracket California taxpayers, and
                                behavioral changes by those who stayed, combined to eliminate 45.2%–nearly half–of the
                                windfall tax revenues from the legislation. Expanding this policy to encompass the
                                entire nation was be a devastating repeat of European failure, sending entrepreneurs and
                                wealth overseas and leaving America both politically divided and economically weak.

                            <p>Wealth taxes will fail America. It will fail the rich by undercutting their self-made
                                success and driving them away from the US. It will fail all other classes by depressing
                                their wages and prosperity and decreasing the available technology and innovation that
                                the wealthier are providing through their assets, investments, and initiatives. Even
                                without ethical considerations, the empirical evidence is clear against a wealth tax in
                                this country from a practical standpoint.
