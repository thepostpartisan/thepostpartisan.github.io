                            <p>It’s common to call the “War on Drugs” a failure. In truth, that would be extremely
                                generous. The “War on Drugs” has been a horrific series of policy choices that have
                                targeted the United States’ most vulnerable populations, and the tens of thousands of
                                deaths every year prove it. After many years, however, people are beginning to fight
                                back: Oregonian voters have taken the first official effort in the United States to
                                decriminalize possession of hard drugs, including heroin and cocaine.

                            </p>

                            <p>Oregon’s most recent step forward is just one example of the public’s changing attitude
                                towards drugs. Of the fifteen states that have legalized marijuana, thirteen did so
                                through ballot initiative measures, with only two coming from state legislation. Thus,
                                it’s clear that these changes were nearly always brought about by the people.

                            </p>

                            <p>Voters are recognizing that the criminalization of drugs is an ineffective and inhumane
                                method of managing drug problems such as the ongoing opioid epidemic, which claims over
                                a hundred lives each day and has taken half a million since the turn of the century. In
                                2016 alone, an estimated 64,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses (more than the
                                combined death tolls for Americans in the Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq Wars).

                            </p>

                            <p>To understand the solution to the opioid epidemic, it is important to understand the
                                difference between legalization and decriminalization. Legalization is the process of
                                removing all legal prohibitions against the drug; decriminalization of a drug means it
                                would remain illegal, but the legal system would not prosecute a person for possession
                                under a specified amount. This is done to separate drug users and drug dealers, and
                                still prosecute dealing. This means that drug problems can be dealt with as health
                                issues instead of criminal ones.

                            </p>

                            <p>This rehabilitative approach to drugs, and justice in general, has inspired dramatic
                                improvements in other societies. Portugal had an extreme drug problem in the decades
                                leading up to the turn of the century, with an estimated 1% of the population being
                                addicted to heroin in the 1990s. Initially, the Portuguese government tried a
                                ‘tough-on-drugs’ strategy, similar to America’s in the 1970s, to quell the problem, but
                                by the end of the 1990s, roughly half of the Portuguese prison population consisted of
                                those with drug addiction problems.

                            </p>

                            <p>In 2001, Portugal reversed its stringent and harmful drug policies and decriminalized all
                                hard drugs, at last recognizing the need to address the issue of drug usage as a health
                                problem, pushing for treatment instead of punishment. As of 2012, Portugal's drug death
                                toll sat at 3 per million, compared to the EU average of 17.3 per million. Additionally,
                                according to a report by the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit created with the goal of
                                ending America’s own “War on Drugs,” the percentage of people in prison in Portugal for
                                drug law violations has been cut almost in half, from 44% in 1999 to 24% in 2013.
                                Between 1998 and 2011, the number of people in drug treatment in Portugal increased by
                                over 60%; nearly three-quarters of them received opioid-substitution therapy.

                            </p>

                            <p>This tried and true strategy to combat drug addiction through decriminalization has been
                                adopted by many other countries, including the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. If
                                used in the United States, it could address key issues such as racial inequality in
                                addition to the opioid epidemic. According to the DPA: “Nearly 80% of people in federal
                                prison and almost 60% of people in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino.
                                Research shows that prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory minimum
                                sentence for black people as for white people charged with the same offense. Among
                                people who received a mandatory minimum sentence in 2011, 38% were Latino and 31% were
                                black,” which is greatly disproportionate to their relative populations in America.

                            </p>

                            <p>Drug criminalization now is still racially charged, no different from other policies put
                                in place years ago. According to the ACLU, “African-Americans do not use drugs more than
                                white people; whites and blacks use drugs at almost exactly the same rates. And since
                                there are five times as many whites as blacks in the United States, it follows that the
                                overwhelming majority of drug users are white. Nevertheless, African-Americans are
                                admitted to state prisons at a rate that is 13.4 times greater than whites, a disparity
                                driven largely by the grossly racial targeting of drug laws. In some states, even those
                                outside the Old Confederacy, blacks make up 90% of drug prisoners and are up to 57 times
                                more likely than whites to be incarcerated for drug crimes.” Results such as these are
                                unsurprising in the context of American policy over the past two centuries. At the turn
                                of the 1900s, Mexican immigration through Texas and Louisiana brought new levels of
                                cannabis, referred to as “marijuana” first by Mexicans. It is worth noting that cannabis
                                was already widely being used in the states, just not referred to as “marijuana”.

                            </p>

                            <p>But first, let’s take a trip down history lane for a while, to really contextualize what
                                that means. Concerning drug policy, one may ask themselves something along the lines of
                                “why is X legal while Y is illegal?” Working backward with the premise that the status
                                quo is relatively fair, this suggests that a scientific committee or studies have proven
                                that Y should be classified as an illicit drug, while X should remain open to the
                                populous. But the truth is, this sensible and verifiable methodology has had nothing to
                                do with the development of drug policy, and still plays a very minimal role in changing
                                policy and culture alike.

                            </p>

                            <p>Historically, policy was mostly generated through rhetoric about who was predominantly
                                using the drug at hand, and their implicit status in society. More often than not,
                                America’s answer to the previously posed question will be that users of Drug Y were
                                viewed as more evil, animalistic, or inferior to those that comprised the upper echelons
                                of society, regardless of what the drug they used was.

                            </p>

                            <p>Back in the 1870s, where the majority of opioid users in America were middle-aged white
                                women, there were no drug experts warning politicians about the effects or addictiveness
                                of opioids: the general view on that demographic at the time meant most didn’t raise an
                                eyebrow at the drug. A higher share of the American population at the time was regularly
                                using opioids than now when the drug epidemic has harmed so many. Criminalization was
                                never even discussed in that context. But beginning in the 1880s, when Chinese
                                immigrants began to make their way to America and subsequently brought opioids with
                                them, all of a sudden, opioid prohibition was an issue at the forefront of politics, and
                                those laws began materializing. Unsurprisingly, they originated in California and
                                Nevada, where most Chinese immigrants resided after sailing across the Pacific. Rhetoric
                                about “Chinamen” growing violent and going after white women formed the basis for these
                                laws, in spite of all evidence that white women had just been using opioids at an
                                incredibly high rate.

                            </p>

                            <p>Similarly, the first anti-cocaine laws sprung up in the early 20th century south to
                                target black people, based on -you guessed it- “Fears of coerced cocaine use, and in
                                particular that young girls would become addicted and thereby enter prostitution… Tales
                                of the corruption of the youth by cocaine were common but there is little evidence to
                                support their veracity.” As far as the media was concerned, that meant “[h]yperbolic
                                reports of the effect of cocaine on African Americans went hand-in-hand with this
                                hysteria. In 1901, the Atlanta Constitution reported that "Use of the drug [cocaine]
                                among negroes is growing to an alarming extent". The New York Times reported that under
                                the influence of cocaine, "sexual desires are increased and perverted...peaceful negroes
                                become quarrelsome, and timid negroes develop a degree of 'Dutch courage' that is
                                sometimes almost incredible". Medical doctors codified the idea that “cocaine is often
                                the direct incentive to the crime of rape by the negroes”, which had absolutely no basis
                                in reality, and, yet again, somehow treated one race of people as affected differently
                                by a drug. In the Mississippi courts, a judge stated that “supplying a “negro” with
                                cocaine was more dangerous than injecting a dog with rabies.”

                            </p>

                            <p>Even alcohol prohibition, which often gets a pass for being racially charged, was
                                directed at perceived second-class immigrants out of predominantly southern and eastern
                                Europe towards the turn of the 19th and 20th century, as opposed to the “American”
                                northern and western immigrants, who had long had no issue with alcohol consumption as
                                long as they were consuming it. The Italian “vino” and the like soon became the target
                                of the same trope of Italians being more prone to criminal behaviors and violence, after
                                many had left the newly fascist Italy in order to continue selling liquor and wine.
                                Anti-Italian sentiment is often glossed over in the racist threads of American history,
                                ignoring the mass lynchings of Italians, and stereotyping of Italian-Americans continues
                                to be incredibly pervasive in the media. In fact, a comprehensive study of
                                Italian-American culture on film, conducted from 1996 to 2001, by the Italic Institute
                                of America, revealed the extent of stereotyping in media. “More than two-thirds of the
                                2,000 films assessed in the study portray Italian Americans in a negative light. Nearly
                                300 films featuring Italian Americans as mobsters have been produced since The Godfather
                                (1972), an average of nine per year.”

                            </p>

                            <p>According to the Italic Institute of America: “The mass media has consistently ignored
                                five centuries of Italian American history, and has elevated what was never more than a
                                minute subculture to the dominant Italian American culture.” And they would be
                                undoubtedly right, according to recent FBI statistics, Italian-American organized crime
                                members and associates number at approximately 3,000. Given an Italian-American
                                population of approximately 18 million, the study concludes that only one in 6,000 has
                                any involvement with organized crime, nowhere near an accurate representation in film or
                                media.

                            </p>

                            <p>It’s not as if the ‘white-white’ Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americans of the time didn’t use
                                these drugs in particular, but rather they figured that, as the chief controllers of
                                systemic power and capital at the time, when they are able to criminalize the vices of
                                other cultural and ethnic backgrounds and leave the execution of those laws to law
                                enforcement that shares the same biases as them, then they are able to maintain control,
                                austerity, and superiority in a constructed and self-perpetuating caste system. They
                                recognized that, inevitably, those laws will not impact or prosecute the upper-class
                                elites to anywhere near the extent of the poor, urban, or racially different groups in
                                their society.

                            </p>

                            <p>Then it should come as no surprise that marijuana was perpetuated in the media as a drug
                                that somehow made men-of-color more ‘degenerate’ or more primal, an idea we may have
                                come across a few times before at this point. During hearings on marijuana law in the
                                1930s, claims were made about marijuana’s ability to cause men of color to become
                                violent and solicit sex from white women. This graphic and prejudiced imagery became the
                                backdrop for the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 which effectively banned its use and sales.

                            </p>

                            <p>Luckily, that was ruled unconstitutional over three decades later, only to be replaced by
                                Richard Nixon in 1970 where cannabis was deemed, yet again, to be in the most
                                restrictive category of drug, citing “dangerousness and potential for addiction”. Nobody
                                in history has ever died by overdosing on marijuana, while tobacco, nicotine, and
                                alcohol have remained, and continue to remain, staples of American culture throughout
                                these years.

                            </p>

                            <p>This disparity even blatantly unjustly impedes educational opportunities for minorities.
                                Under The Higher Education Act of 1998, “any drug conviction blocks or delays all
                                federal educational assistance, including loans and even work-study programs.” According
                                to the ACLU, “given that 55% of those convicted of drug offenses are black and the fact
                                that this law will not affect the wealthy who do not need financial aid, the HEA plainly
                                targets low-income people of color. Murder and rape do not render a person ineligible;
                                someone could burn a nursery or bomb a federal building and still receive financial aid.
                                But smoking marijuana in the privacy of one's own room means a student risks losing
                                financial aid and having to leave college or graduate school.”

                            </p>

                            <p>These same disgusting and unfounded biases echo far throughout drug policy, such as the
                                separate sentencing of powdered cocaine and crack, both of which are the same substance,
                                but often possessed by different demographics of people. White people skewed towards
                                powdered cocaine, while the black community: crack. Enforcement has, unsurprisingly,
                                cracked down harder on the latter community for the same drug. And these policies have
                                far-reaching consequences. 13% of African-Americans are disenfranchised of their right
                                to vote, and one out of every nine black children have an incarcerated parent.
                                Fortunately for us, the right-to-vote in codified law is very specific for ex-felons,
                                such as in Alabama where “Alabama law permanently strips voting rights for those who
                                have been convicted of a crime of "moral turpitude.”” Moral turpitude is never defined
                                or listed as a group of felonies or offenses in Alabama law at all, leaving us to
                                speculate, with probably some educated guesses, why 31.5% of black men in Alabama are
                                disenfranchised of their right to vote?

                            </p>

                            <p>Additionally, these consequences of racist policies do not exist in a political vacuum,
                                they spur the Willie Horton ads of our day, the gateway drug myths, and so on. They
                                create a culture where the mob or mafia is often glorified in the media as the italian
                                demographic has grown somewhat more accepted into the fluid category of “white”, or at
                                least portrayed as complex and intelligent crime syndicates, while many would scoff at a
                                similar portrayal of gangs or cartels.
                            </p>

                            <p>Even while service and retail workers are often subject to drug tests and the potential
                                consequences that follow, the wealthy corporate class of America usually doesn’t have
                                drug tests at the workplace, regardless of the perceived effects/myths on productivity
                                (which they often produce) that permeate the cultural view on drug use.

                            </p>

                            <p>This consistent use of racist and classist recycled bigotry is the foundation of many of
                                our drug policies and overall attitudes today. This isn’t to say that all of the war on
                                drugs can be boiled down to that, but it plays the largest role by far in it, from
                                deciding the origins of policy to its enforcement to who ultimately gets
                                disproportionately victimized as the out-group or undesirables.

                            </p>Through the decriminalization and legalization of various drugs, we can create a
                            multi-faceted approach to drug abuse, social stigma, and racial inequality. Of course, there
                            is still much work to do in pursuit of solving these issues, and decriminalization of drugs
                            will not be the end of them, but if these measures are indicative of a new era of drug
                            policy, the future looks somewhat more encouraging. It’s time for America to understand that
                            the misnomered “War on Drugs” has only really been an archaic, outdated method of
                            not-so-friendly fire trained on vulnerable Americans over decades. Body counts in hospitals,
                            prisons, and graveyards have been piling up, and it’s time to do something about it.
                            Oregonians have taken a monumental first step, and it’s time we all follow suit.
