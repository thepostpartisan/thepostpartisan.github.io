                experimental
                fascism. </p>
              <p></p>

              <p> But first, some historical context.</p>

              <p>Overt fearmongering about anarchism, rioting, and looting is all the federal government needs to
                provide a veneer of justification. In fact, this lie of pre-emptive self-defense has always been an easy
                out for the government, from the Native American genocide to the HUAC committee of the Red Scare, to
                separate sentencing for black people during the war on drugs, to the Iraq War weapons of mass
                destruction lie, to the installation of the Patriot Act, and even to the <a

                  touted by the CIA to bomb
                  Miami and target Cubans, just to make Fidel Castro look bad</a>, crocodile tear self-defense as
                justification to act on aggression is a staple in the American propaganda playbook.</p>

              <p>Let’s talk about what exactly has happened in Portland.</p>

              <p>The first question we must address is where has the violence been? I’ll grant that there have been some
                hotspots of vandalism, but the $5,000 in federal property damage in Portland, <a
                  href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland">reported
                  by the Department
                  of Homeland Security</a>, is not a justification for federal agents to begin swooping in and literally
                kidnapping people, nevertheless innocent ones.</p>

              <p>Take Mark Pettibone, an innocent protestor black-bagged before he was told what he was being arrested
                for and by whom. These arrests target and profile anybody dressed in black with a mask on. NPR’s
                interview reads: “Blinded by his hat, in an unmarked minivan full of armed people dressed in camouflage
                and body armor who hadn't identified themselves, Pettibone said he was driven around downtown before
                being unloaded inside a building. He wouldn't learn until after his release that he had been inside the
                federal courthouse.” According to Pettibone’s interview with the Washington Post, “he did not know
                whether the men were police or far-right extremists, who frequently don military-like outfits and harass
                left-leaning protesters in Portland.” His fear of, extremist right-wing violence is entirely justified,
                after two members of the ><a
                  href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-17/far-right-boogaloo-boys-linked-to-killing-of-california-lawmen-other-violence">Boogaloo
                  Boys murdered multiple law enforcement officials in California</a> in
                order to accelerate a race war, as well as clips being leaked of <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKdHhZyRuQ">police officers communicating with the
                  Proud Boys in Salem, Oregon</a> (not far from Portland) to go inside before they begin gassing
                protestors.
                And frankly, I doubt any of us would be able to tell the difference between alt-right terrorists and
                federal agents if the soldiers failed to identify themselves.</p>

              <img src="../../img/issues/one/portland1.JPG" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image 1">

              <p><br>On Friday, U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams, the Department of Justice's chief law enforcement
                official in Oregon, called for an inspector general investigation into DHS personnel over reports of two
                protesters being detained without probable cause.</p>

              <p>In response to national outcry against this abuse of power, acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, an
                unelected official, has demonstrated a blatant disregard for the Constitution, <a
                  href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1285224329878306817?s=20">stating</a> in an interview “I
                don't need invitations by the state, state mayors, or state governors to do our job. We're going to do
                that, whether they like us there or not."</p>

              <p>And to no surprise, when Sean Hannity of Fox News proposed a hypothetical during an interview with
                Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, where federal officers fire live ammunition on protestors, the far-right
                Cotton <a href="https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1285756299033088000">conveniently forgot about
                  due process and the Constitution</a> and determines that the protestors, or
                as he so eloquently puts it, “[those] pelting frozen water bottles and throwing sharpened sticks” are to
                blame for their deaths, a scenario oddly reminiscent of a historical moment in American history where
                soldiers were being harassed by colonists, and shot and killed multiple: the Boston Massacre.</p>

              <p>Additionally, keep in mind that Antifa protestors have killed not a single soul to date and <a
                  href="https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/what-threat-united-states-today/">far-right
                  terrorism is responsible for 73% of politically-motivated deaths since 9/11.</a> This would suggest
                that the
                so-called anarchists are basically a non-threat in comparison to the far-right extremists.</p>

              <p>In fact, recent protests have overwhelmingly been peaceful, as Zoe Carpenter, a Portland resident,
                wrote: “The mood in the crowd downtown is often jovial—at least until law enforcement arrives—with
                people dancing and chanting and giving out vegan stew, barbecue, and donated bike helmets. On Friday
                night around 10:30 PM, shortly after federal forces started spraying tear gas, filling a city block with
                noxious fumes”. This anecdote is also consistent with conservative Greg Doucette’s observations, who has
                compiled a list of over <a href="https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1266751520055459847?s=20">800
                  unprovoked police brutality incidents</a> during only the George Floyd protests.
              </p>

              <p>This type of mass hysteria and fearmongering has been used by the American government to repeatedly
                beat American dissidents and patriots into submission. Never forget the six Ferguson organizers that
                <a
                  href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-ferguson-activist-deaths-black-lives-matter-20190317-story.html">mysteriously
                  died</a>, or one of their predecessors, Fred Hampton, a 21-year-old working on bringing
                together gangs and races through class solidarity of the Black Panther Party. The young activist was the
                target of an illegal and immoral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> FBI
                program and assassinated, along with fellow Panther Mark
                Clark, by the Chicago Police Department and FBI in his home next to his pregnant wife. In fact, other
                Panthers in the apartment heard this exchange between officers during the break-in:</p>

              <p> “That's Fred Hampton.”
                <br>"Is he dead?... Bring him out."
                <br>"He's barely alive."
                <br>"He'll make it."
              </p>

              <p>The injured Panthers said they heard two shots. According to Hampton's supporters, the shots were fired
                point-blank at Hampton's head. According to Deborah Johnson, an officer then said:</p>

              <p>"He's good and dead now."</p>


              <p>Each panther in the room that night was charged with manslaughter as the police publicly claimed: “the
                arrest team had been attacked by the "violent" and "extremely vicious" Panthers and had defended
                themselves accordingly by responding with fatal shots. In a second press conference on December 8, the
                police leadership praised the assault team for their "remarkable restraint", "bravery", and
                "professional discipline" in not killing all the Panthers present.”</p>


              <p>Later evidence was uncovered that exonerated the Panthers, as only one bullet was shot from Clark’s
                shotgun into the ceiling while ninety-nine bullets were fired by the Chicago Police Department.</p>


              <p>Situations like Portland and Chicago demonstrate the cognitive dissonance and manipulative nature of
                the government. It’s easy to shout buzz words like freedom and liberty, as long as the people continue
                to look past the ever-increasing body count. </p>


              <p>And if you still have reservations on whether or not true fascism and forcible suppression of the
                opposition is in the works, I believe that when federal agents and the president <a
                  href="https://www.salon.com/2020/07/24/trumps-dhs-tried-to-block-netflix-from-airing-immigration-nation-until-after-the-election-report_partner/">block
                  footage of the
                  results of their own immigration policies</a> before election day, it’s safe to say that our
                constitutional
                freedoms of speech, the press, and protests are merely politically charged suggestions for our
                authorities.</p>


              <p>Please don’t buy into the tactical fearmongering of the United States government, which has time and
                time again been a dangerous front for real casualties. Question the authorities, especially under
                iniquitous circumstances. We must be able to recognize the warning signs of a fascist police-state
                before the bodies begin piling up, and Portland very well may be ground zero for the next wave of
                totalitarianism.</p>


              <p>In these times, we should remember American historian Howard Zinn’s timeless words: “Historically, the
                most terrible things - war, genocide, and slavery - have resulted not from disobedience, but from
                obedience.”</p>

              <p>In solidarity.</p>
