                            <p>From the Roman Empire to Chinese dynasties to Cold War-era African regimes, coups have
                                thrown wrenches into the stream of history, marking the erosion of domestic governmental
                                legitimacy as well as the rest of the world’s perception of a state. Since such forceful
                                grabs of power appear to contradict the democratic ideals America has long
                                championed,citizens of both the United States and the rest of the world were appalled at
                                the attempted coup in Washington DC.

                            </p>

                            <p>Overwhelmingly, the world responded with condolences and statements of sustained faith in
                                America’s democratic institutions- with the exception of China, America’s main rival in
                                geopolitical and economic power. In staggering contrast to expressions of sympathy and
                                hope, Chinese state media called the pro-Trump riots a “beautiful sight,” mocking Nancy
                                Pelosi’s previous statements about anti-CCP demonstrations in Hong Kong, accusing
                                Washington of hypocrisy and karma in their trumpeting of democracy overseas, while
                                blatantly not serving the will of their people (as seen in the Capitol’s riots). Early
                                the next morning, the site for US’ embassy in China was overloaded with jeering
                                messages: “Why don’t you come to work on time? We are all here waiting for you to talk
                                of US democracy and values.” Twitter suspending Trump’s account also drew criticism,
                                since America has a record of condemning China’s suppression of speech. But on a more
                                serious note, a loud consensus among Chinese online discourse was that the Capitol’s
                                spiraling into chaos was the “falling of the beacon of democracy” - an implicit nod to
                                January 6th as the prelude to China’s ascension to America’s status.

                            </p>

                            <p>For all of Trump’s slander against China, along with the backdrop of America’s
                                self-ordained reputation as the leader of the free world, the events of January 6th lend
                                themselves to an insidious insight: Trump and the CCP share more similarities, in the
                                form of power-holding tactics, than they make themselves out to.

                            </p>

                            <p>The CCP and Trump share disinformation as a common means of controlling the populace.
                                Trump’s instances of blatant and divisive falsehoods are pretty undeniable- downplaying
                                COVID19, largely rejecting environmental and virological science, and boasting that the
                                economy is the “greatest it’s ever been,”, to name a few. He has constantly reinforced a
                                “them vs us” mentality- in the past several months especially - scoffing at the idea of
                                providing federal assistance to Democrat-led cities and states, labeling BLM protestors
                                as “terrorists” and “angry mobs,” and the rise in calls for social justice in general as
                                “far left fascism” and a “cultural revolution,” “attacking our country.” Over the past
                                four years, multiple studies indicate that political polarization has accelerated, due
                                to a rise in reactionary and sensationalist media, algorithmic echo chambers, negative
                                partisanship, and rampant misinformation through the internet.

                            </p>

                            <p>A staple of Trump’s simultaneously self-victimizing and self-righteous rhetoric is the
                                perpetual accusation of fake news, of media (which he insinuates as unilaterally
                                left-leaning) waging war against him and the average citizen. As a result, those who
                                identify as Republicans have decreased their trust in the news overall, almost solely
                                relying on Fox News and even further right outlets for information. Trump’s promotion of
                                conspiracy theories is another layer on top of the divided hellscape he paints for his
                                audience - questioning Obama’s birth certificate; suggesting that Obama had supported
                                ISIS as president; proposing that a 75-year-old man confronted by police was part of
                                Antifa. Such claims open up the range of reality to seem more threatening, encouraging
                                constant, irrational fear and suspicion on partisan grounds - with Trump himself as a
                                messiah-like exposer of lies.

                            </p>

                            <p>Alternately, the CCP uses disinformation on its citizens to homogenize them into a
                                nationalist bloc that believes their government and country are superior - most directly
                                in comparison to America, as its main riva - rather than pit internal factions against
                                one another or idealize a single person. Chinese and American exceptionalism are two
                                wings of the same propagandistic bird. Over the past year, COVID-19 and US domestic
                                unrest were hot topics for Chinese disinformation. In late December 2019, when a doctor
                                shared an image of the first COVID-19 diagnostic test with a warning to his seven
                                coworkers, its subsequent circulation resulted in his being detained and forced to sign
                                a statement of secrecy and self indictment for “disrupting social order” by authorities.
                                Medical experts agree that if China had not stalled for the next three weeks, intensely
                                censoring and removing content online with keywords regarding Wuhan, viruses, lockdowns,
                                and crises, and forbidding medical institutions from passing treatments for COVID19,
                                countless lives would’ve been saved. Citizens’ outrage at the government’s stalling was
                                suppressed, and any factual basis for such discontent was removed from the internet to
                                be replaced with conspiracy theories about how the US military was the source fo the
                                virus, altered records of cases in China, and false, demeaning reports of European and
                                American handling of the virus - including tales of European healthcare workers leaving
                                patients to die and Trump planning to lock down the entire US - to showcase relative
                                competence.

                            </p>

                            <p>By blocking external sources of information and censoring content internally, the
                                government essentially only permits a single narrative to exist in the public, which
                                they can reinforce officially with their own accounts and broadcasts. This gives the
                                average Chinese citizen no choice but to either believe the government, or to not
                                believe anything at all. Since the latter is more difficult - knowing that what the
                                media and others say is false, but having no safe way of knowing what is true - most
                                citizens are forced into a state of passive acceptance of a constructed sense of
                                reality. This architecting of trust in the government is an interesting complement to
                                Trump’s tactics. Where Trump points fingers to stir suspicion in everything producing
                                information other than himself and his allies, the Chinese government does the same to
                                everything outside of its entire government- a nationalistic, rather than self-centered
                                or partisan, agenda.

                            </p>

                            <p>In regards to American domestic unrest during 2020, the CCP capitalized on the images of
                                police violence in America that mirrored the ones the US had so often condemned in the
                                streets of Hong Kong. China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats, labeled as such from a Chinese
                                movie about a Chinese commando who kills American criminals with his bare hands,
                                gleefully spun out rhetoric to paint America as violent, rampant with discrimination,
                                and fundamentally dysfunctional and hypocritical. It’s not like China is actually better
                                in any of these respects; their unrestrained police force, concentration camps of Ughur
                                Muslims and military occupation and suppression of Tibetans speak for themselves - not
                                to mention their targeting Africans living in Guangzhou with arbitrary evictions and
                                implicit house arrest in response to COVID-19. What’s important to note is that this
                                antagonistic sort of rhetoric parallels the kind Trump himself used against the same BLM
                                protestors- hateful, mobs, destroyers of America, even threatening fatal violence (“when
                                the looting starts, the shooting starts”) - but on a more narrow-minded and
                                short-sighted scale. Especially in context of Beijing scrambling to preserve their
                                standing after being exposed (at least partially) for intentional mismanaging of COVID19
                                in the face of primarily America (Trump)’s accusations, the protests and Trump’s
                                response were the perfect opportunity to flip the narrative.

                            </p>

                            <p>Experts and analysts have generally concluded that the aim of Trump’s aggressive rhetoric
                                is not to expand his base, but to whip them up into higher fervor and to see him as the
                                only source of authenticity. But what is more central in light of events at the Capitol
                                is not Trump’s undermining of public faith in the media, but in government institutions-
                                namely, the election system. In 2016, Trump insinuated that he wouldn’t concede if if
                                the election results indicated he didn’t win, tweeted “I won the popular vote if you
                                deduct the millions of people who voted illegally” following the election, and even
                                formed a blatantly partisan coalition - who were prolific for heralding election fraud
                                tales - in the Presidential Advisory Commision on Election Integrity.

                            </p>

                            <p>After two years of fruitless data-demanding and perusing, it was disbanded, only to be
                                replaced with Trump leading a charge to sow doubt about the validity of the 2018
                                midterms, with tweets invoking suspicions about Russian interference in support of
                                Democrats, or strategic influxes of illegal immigrants to inflate Democrat votes. In the
                                months leading up to the 2020 election, he tweeted “THERE IS NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In
                                Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,” repeatedly claiming the
                                election would be rigged and then loudly launching over fifty lawsuits in swing states
                                to dispute his losing results. As icing on the cake of crap, Trump and his campaign were
                                gearing up for Trump 2024 announcements as early as the beginning of November 2020, a
                                blatant violation of constitutionality and precedent. The strength, bluntness, and
                                frequency of his election skepticism draws power in the form of public trust away from
                                the government, and vests it in Trump himself as a sort of transcendent preacher of the
                                “truth” and had the presidential office “stolen” from him.

                            </p>

                            <p>The CCP has a different way of undermining elections- they don’t have them. Better yet,
                                as of early 2018, they simply abolished term limits for the presidency. Even in light of
                                Xi Jinping’s recent escalating efforts to revamp internal and cyber infrastructure and
                                the military and inject more nationalist and traditional Confucian philosophy in
                                education, this step was an alarming swipe at power, since it was only near the end of
                                his first term (rather than his second), indicating a long-term agenda that couldn’t
                                wait. Given Xi’s idolizing of Mao, and viewing himself as meant to carry on Mao’s legacy
                                - a regime defined by state-orchestrated mass murder, famine, instigating and fueling
                                wars in several countries, and attempting to strongman Taiwan into submission - Xi’s
                                plans for the future could be a harrowing threat for the rest of the world and Chinese
                                citizens.

                            </p>

                            <p>The Chinese constitution still says that the president can serve for a standard of two
                                terms (ten years), but is now missing the line stating they can’t serve for over two
                                consecutive terms, which makes the previous clause essentially meaningless. Xi already
                                is the CCP’s general secretary and military chief, both of which don’t have any term
                                limits to begin with. Securing himself such indefinite power drastically overhauls all
                                tumultuous political precedent since Mao, and opens up possibilities for even more
                                deviation from the past structures of stability. Already during his first term, Xi has
                                cracked down on dissent and corruption, thus ousting political rivals as well as winning
                                public support, something Trump tried to achieve but failed in (making false allegations
                                of fraud against Ted Cruz for winning in the Iowa caucus, launching a plethora of
                                personal attacks on Joe Biden throughout his campaign).

                            </p>

                            <p>Like Xi, Trump’s term has also defied virtually every precedent of the office, but I’ll
                                focus on legality and policy rather than more subjective areas of rhetoric and
                                character. In addition to aggressively contesting the election, at the latest G7 summit,
                                Trump trivialized the international conference into a self-plug for his businesses and
                                golf courses - thus violating the Constitution’s clause preventing presidents from
                                financially profiting off foreign governments without Congress’ consent. When the House
                                of Representatives repeatedly sent subpoenas for Trump’s financial and administration
                                records, he completely ignored them, flaunting a lack of penalization for dodging or
                                even acknowledging accountability, as well as weakening Congressional power. He’s even
                                publicly claimed to have “fell in love” with Kim Jong Un, the dictator of one of the
                                most backwards and oppressive, authoritarian countries in the world, setting a harrowing
                                precedent for future American foreign alliances.

                            </p>

                            <p>The 65 members of Trump’s executive office (roles like Chief of Staff, National Security
                                Advisor, Press Secretary, etc) have a turnover rate of 91%, consistently for disagreeing
                                with Trump rather than actual incompetence. Examples include Secretary of Defense Mark
                                Esper being fired for opposing Trump’s demands to use active duty troops to face
                                protestors, which in itself is an anomaly since technically it occurred so close to the
                                election and subsequent transition and is generally interpreted as a symptom of an
                                unstable government. Michaul Atkinson, the US inspector general, was also fired soon
                                after receiving the impeachment trial-inducing notice by a CIA whistleblower (the phone
                                call between Trump and the Ukranian president where Trump used financial aid as leverage
                                for Ukraine investigating Biden), a move widely criticized as a strike against speaking
                                the truth. This Ukraine incident also crosses significant legal lines, most notably
                                leveraging foreign aid for personal gain violates the Impoundment Control Act in the
                                Constitution. This plethora of political and legal violations, while not as dystopian as
                                Xi’s record, is still having the same type of effect on American institutions: reducing
                                their validity through a single political actor.

                            </p>

                            <p>It’s expected that the power dynamic between China and America will take a turn after the
                                latest events at the Capitol. Trump’s more egocentric version of the CCP’s consolidation
                                of power has blatantly failed, both itself and in the face of American ideals’
                                precedents and a global audience. Xi’s successful version of achieving authoritarianism
                                will only stand out as such in comparison to a self-destructive and polarized America;
                                even if the CCP’s Orwellian practices are obvious, perhaps the rest of the world will
                                have no choice but to begin to look towards them for leadership due to their sheer power
                                and apparent stability. Despite following in the similar, albeit diminished footsteps of
                                the CCP in gaining power, Trump’s self-centered policies were too impulsive and
                                shortsighted to amount to anything more than headlines and polarization rather than
                                strengthen America. As different as the two global superpowers seek to be, power is
                                power, and power-grabbing tactics don’t discriminate by geopolitics.

                            </p>

                            <p>The culmination of four years of Trump’s impulsive lashing out and feeding hysteria in
                                his base has blown up in his face, humiliating Americans, and giving China an opening to
                                truly assert themselves as the apex global leader.
