                            <p>As America continues to be in an increasingly politically, as well as culturally, divided
                                state, one finds that religion lies at the center of this disunity. One issue that
                                clearly elucidates this schism is the difference in religious Americans’ versus
                                non-religious Americans’ approaches to abortion. The 2013 Summer Christian Lawyer
                                Magazine’s reflection on the landmark case Roe v. Wade, reveals the level to which
                                religious and non-religious peoples in America live within divergent cosmic dramas, as
                                each group retains its own narrative regarding the inception of personhood, as well as
                                the institution of marriage in regards to the 14th Amendment. These two groups maintain
                                and utilize a unique discourse: the religious right takes a strict stance on abortion in
                                light of religious reasoning, and the non-affiliated left disregards their argument
                                almost entirely in favor of a more feminist and secular rationalization. In effect, both
                                maintain and embolden their own arguments and beliefs, respectively.

                            </p>

                            <p> The 2013 Summer Christian Lawyer Magazine is a publication by the Christian Legal
                                Society. The CLS is a, “non-profit, non-denominational organization of Christian
                                lawyers, judges, law professors, and law students and friends whose members profess to
                                follow the ‘commandment of Jesus’ to ‘seek justice with the love of God’”. This
                                organization works to provide legal aid to those in need, and promote the practice of
                                law with a higher moral obligation in mind. The source material to be discussed in this
                                essay, specifically pages 1-7, includes:

                            </p>

                            <p>1) a letter from the Executive Director of the CLS regarding the sanctity of life, as
                                well as,

                            </p>

                            <p>2) an article from the pro-life legal superstar, Tom Brejcha, reflecting on the
                                implications of Roe v. Wade 40 years after the decision.

                            </p>

                            <p>Both the letter and the article reveal the stark differences between the perspectives of
                                those of a religious background, specifically Christian in this case, and those with a
                                secular understanding of abortion. This source elucidates a completely different
                                understanding of the inception of life and the sanctity of marriage from that of the
                                secular perspective, and in effect allows for drastically different interpretation of
                                the jurisprudence on which Roe v. Wade was decided between the religious and the
                                non-religious.

                            </p>

                            <p> The gap between these two groups’ understandings of the world is evident through the
                                magazine’s reframing of conception’s narrative through religious and moral lens. In the
                                Executive Director’s opening letter regarding the sanctity of life, he claims that,
                                “Since Roe, nearly 55 million unborn children have died at the hands of abortionists in
                                this country alone.” From a secular perspective, these abortions would not be considered
                                “deaths” as the secular idea of personhood differs from the religious understanding that
                                life begins at conception. The Director continues by calling on his fellow Christians to
                                “fight for life”2, emphasizing the idea that life and personhood are determined at
                                conception. In the article itself, the opening paragraph cites the fact that, “Many
                                Christian young people, born a generation or more after Roe, sport t-shirts or
                                sweatshirts emblazoned with arresting slogans such as, ‘I survived Roe v. Wade.’” The
                                implication here is that abortion is equivalent to infanticide, and that those who are
                                born are lucky to have survived, which dramatically reframes of the secular narrative
                                that abortion is simply an extraction of fetal cells at a time when their removal from
                                the womb would result in a limited chance of survival.

                            </p>

                            <p> In contrast, legal terms (which are generally secular) dictate that a fetus may only be
                                aborted up until it is viable (it can survive outside the womb). In Floyd v. Anders it
                                was decided that, “the proscription against abortions performed after the twenty-fourth
                                week of pregnancy was unconstitutional because the state may only forbid abortions when
                                the fetus is viable.” In addition, Roe v. Wade, maintained the idea that viability
                                exists at quickening (the stage in pregnancy where the woman can feel the baby’s
                                movements) or conception is “no longer strongly regarded as relevant by science,”4
                                supporting the claim that, “the fetus is not a person.”4 This assessment of personhood
                                diverges sharply from the religious claim presented in the Christian Lawyer Magazine,
                                illustrating two separate realities in which the beginning of life and personhood are
                                understood to occur at different points during the human gestation period.

                            </p>

                            <p> The article in the Magazine specifically reflects on Roe v. Wade, and encourages readers
                                to fight this “profoundly regrettable decision”3 by providing a framework for legal
                                reasoning to be used in court, when challenging this case and others like it. The
                                article portrays Roe v. Wade’s most important antecedent and arguably its foundation to
                                be Griswold v. Connecticut, which invalidated an old, unenforced law banning the use of
                                contraception at the behest of a married couple. In this decision, the Court explains
                                that this statute ‘invaded the sacred precincts of the marital bedroom’”3, a course of
                                reasoning that the CLS nullifies, since it’s intentionally conducive to the concept of
                                marriage as a religious institution rather than an objective social one. Arguing that
                                this focus on marriage’s alleged sanctity is invalid, the CLS argues that the Court
                                should have based their decision on, ‘the right of privacy...the right of an individual,
                                married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion.’”3 CLS claims “a
                                liberty that had been based on the special position of the married was made universal in
                                a way that repudiated the legally privileged status of marriage … a massive departure
                                from the long line of cases that [represent] a vindication of the family.”3 Essentially,
                                the CLS argues that the government having a say in abortion would violate the
                                prestigious kind of privacy that a marriage legally defined as embodying. The CLS
                                concludes that Roe v. Wade’s decision is incorrect as its precedents refer to the legal
                                protection of the sacred institution of marriage, rather than the liberty of the woman
                                to maintain her privacy and act of her own free will.

                            </p>

                            <p>Most secularists would argue that a woman is entitled to the right to privacy through the
                                14th and 1st amendments. Secularists acknowledge the interest in the potentiality of
                                life, but argue that this must be balanced against the woman’s right to privacy.4
                                Alternatively, the religious right believes life begins at conception. However, legal
                                courts have clearly acknowledged a denial of personhood, and therefore a denial of
                                rights, for the fetus, therefore weighing the interests of the mother above those of the
                                fetus.4

                            </p>

                            <p>In effect, these polarized views perpetuate divergent rhetoric regarding the issue. The
                                cultural discourse surrounding the issue of a “fetal heartbeat” versus a “forced
                                pregnancy” reinforces drastic divides in understanding and emotional reactions, among
                                Americans when are confronted with the idea of abortion. The magazine claims that, “at
                                its core, abortion is not a legal, philosophical, or popular debate. It is about real
                                life and death.”2 More shocking language in the article used to describe abortion
                                include, “moral madness and ultimately evil”2 and “killing an infant because he or she
                                is unwanted is evil”2. The article’s clearest conveyance of the CLS’s opinion, and in
                                reflection the Christian right’s opinion, is the claim that, “pro-lifers see Roe as an
                                abominable cover for killing one’s inconvenient offspring, cheapening sexuality,
                                sundering and undermining the bonds of family and community, and achieving, by slower
                                degrees, in the aggregate yet another 20th-21st century mass holocaust.”2 The language
                                and the rhetoric in the phrases are clearly intended to evoke an emotional reaction.
                                This religious discourse enforces a culture focused on obeying a higher power and the
                                conservative values that result from this religious commitment. The emotional strength
                                of this doctrine’s ideals enforce a deep divide that prevents agreement or understanding
                                on either side.

                            </p>

                            <p> To contrast the rhetoric of this article, one must also analyze secular discourse
                                regarding abortion. In The New England Journal of Medicine, the author Elizabeth Nash
                                begins by writing “abortion rights”, immediately contextualizing abortion as an inherent
                                and inalienable right, rather than a brutal practice likened to infanticide. Nash refers
                                to abortions in medical terms, akin to any other medical procedure or service. Using
                                secular, purely scientific and legal language to describe the flaws surrounding abortion
                                liberties and laws in the United States, she uses phrases such as, “restricted both
                                public and private insurance coverage,” and “burdensome and unnecessary standards”6.
                                This choice to use such secular and unemotional verbiage is intentional, mirroring the
                                reasonable nature of secular culture, where an abortion is merely another medical
                                process, and that the individual is entitled to this procedure by their, “rights to
                                maintain their bodily autonomy and dignity and to determine their own lives and
                                futures.”6 This straightforward and medical interpretation of abortion contrasts greatly
                                with the previously analyzed religious perspective, displaying how both parties are
                                isolated within their mentalities and perceptions of reality.

                            </p>

                            <p> The 2013 Summer Christian Lawyer Magazine allows for an interesting analysis of the ways
                                in which Christian and secular peoples live in different realities, specifically in
                                their approaches to the issue of abortion. The magazine illuminates these starkly
                                different realities through its narration of the concepts of life and personhood, its
                                religiously-based legal interpretation, as well as its use of emotionally impactful
                                rhetoric regarding the issue. While right-wing Christians espouse the sanctity of life
                                and the horrors of infanticide, liberalist secularists argue for the right of bodily
                                autonomy and a woman’s right to privacy. It is clear to see that these two groups have
                                no overlapping understandings; their arguments simply cannot weigh against one another
                                since they each conflict with the other’s reality. How are these diametrically opposed
                                groups to come to a consensus or an agreement on law when the facts at hand are
                                fundamentally disputable in the eyes of each group? The schism that the issue of
                                abortion has created among secularists and Christians has not only created a
                                polarization among people based on belief, but in fact has binarized the entire United
                                States around a single wedge issue, with no clear path to agreement or resolution ahead.
