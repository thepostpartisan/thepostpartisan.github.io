                            <p>If the past few months have demonstrated anything, it’s that social justice issues drive
                                popular politics. They have become the centralized issue of this election and while I
                                agree that they are without a doubt an extremely important factor, it has also become
                                evident that a significant amount of people do not know the nuances of either
                                candidate's plans outside of these issues. The most important of these are their
                                respective economic policies. A lot of people who support Donald Trump state that he
                                will mention how he plans on bringing back jobs or reduce taxes without being able to
                                prove how effective his ideas are, and just as many people who support Biden will focus
                                strictly on his impact or stance in social issues without having much of an idea about
                                what his impact will be on the economy. The reality of the matter is that the condition
                                of the economy will be one of, if not the most important measure of success at the end
                                of the next four years. Social justice issues can fluctuate between different parties
                                and people indefinitely, but without a strong economy, the same Americans whose human
                                rights are being discussed will be out of jobs due to the empty, predatory promises of
                                whichever candidate takes the White House.
                            </p>

                            <p>With that in mind, let's examine exactly what Joe Biden and Donald Trump have planned.
                            </p>

                            <p><i>“We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the
                                    expense of others. We support free trade but it needs to be fair and it needs to be
                                    reciprocal.” - Donald Trump at Davos</i></p>

                            <p>Over the past four years, Donald Trump’s experience as a businessman has clearly
                                influenced his policies. He has oriented around the idea of bolstering the domestic
                                economy and larger corporations in order to produce jobs for the average middle class
                                citizen. He also has publicly criticized the outsourcing of jobs more than any president
                                in recent years, aiming to bring manufacturing jobs back to American workers. With these
                                priorities, his policies have featured corporate and individual tax cuts, trade
                                protectionism through tariffs, and targeting the Affordable Care Act.
                            </p>

                            <p>Trump's denouncement of outsourcing has been most evident in America’s trade relationship
                                with China. Trump has aggressively advocated for the use of tariffs in order to reduce
                                our budget deficit and bring back domestic manufacturing which has seen a dramatically
                                steep decline in the last 20 or so years. In 2017, on top of a $336 billion trade
                                deficit with China, the US also lost anywhere from $225 billion to $600 billion annually
                                from intellectual property theft indicating that China’s involvement in IP theft is a
                                considerably serious issue. Trump as a result has heightened tensions with China over
                                his presidency with tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, a recent escalation being the
                                attempted ban on WeChat and Tik Tok due to the claim that they allow for an invasion of
                                privacy of American users. Trump’s policies, while completely reasonable in intention
                                considering that China is easily the biggest current threat to America economically,
                                have yet to see any considerable results in terms of increases in domestic manufacturing
                                or success within the trade war. While the number of US manufacturing jobs increased up
                                until 2019, COVID wiped out a significant amount of them and even prior to the pandemic,
                                the rate of increase was not noticeably larger than that of the manufacturing sector
                                under former president Barack Obama. Trump’s tariffs are instead, resulting in
                                retaliation from China and causing US imports to now have higher tariffs placed on them
                                there, while American companies such as Tesla have sued the government for the increased
                                costs they face in manufacturing due to the tariffs. Trump’s view and rhetoric on
                                outsourcing is something that many Americans understandably share in an attempt to bring
                                jobs back to citizens; however, the execution of such policies over the last four years
                                has not proven to be entirely successful, and whether he would be able to do anything
                                considerably different in the next four is up for debate. However, outsourcing does seem
                                to be an issue that Trump has more of a stronghold over in comparison to Joe Biden,
                                which will be discussed later.
                            </p>

                            <p>Secondly, the tax cuts under Trump have been touted as a catalyst for a booming economy
                                over the last three years but have also come with a serious disparity between how much
                                wealthy and middle class citizens benefitted. The Tax Cuts and Job Act has been the
                                largest overhaul of the tax code in the last 30 years. Most significantly, it reduced
                                the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, as well as instating a $10,000 limit on how much
                                in state and local taxes can be deducted from an individual’s federal income taxes. It’s
                                evident that large corporations and the wealthy have benefited significantly from the
                                tax cuts, considering that the act targets tax cuts for corporations, as well as
                                eliminating estate taxes- which previously only applied to people with incomes of $11
                                million or more. Trump’s argument in defense of these cuts is that the $1.5 trillion in
                                deficits over the next 10 years (from the tax overhaul) will be compensated for by the
                                economic growth that corporations provide. Prior to the pandemic, Trump’s economy seemed
                                to reflect his goals of the tax cuts with most economists agreeing that the economy in
                                terms of unemployment rate and quality of life had been in impressive condition
                                regardless of whether or not they believed his tax promises in the long term. So while
                                the tax plan might seem as though wealthy people benefit more, it is important to regard
                                the idea that the overall improvement in middle class unemployment before the pandemic
                                was a noticeable accomplishment on his part.
                            </p>

                            <p>The last aspect of Trump’s economic policy has been the Affordable Care Act. Now that the
                                individual mandate, most prominently contested for its unconstitutionality, has been
                                eliminated, his current stance is no longer clear. In recent events, Trump has signed an
                                executive action to protect people with preexisting conditions, as well as promising
                                that senior Americans will receive $200 to put towards prescription drugs in a series of
                                executive actions to protect citizens from unexpected medical costs. The logistics and
                                funding of this $200 plan have not been released by the White House, and this plan is
                                currently the only indication of any substantive Trump healthcare plan. This is an issue
                                that many should take notice of with the Trump administration: while they have discussed
                                and established ideas of what aspects of healthcare they want to remove they seem to
                                have no clear idea of what healthcare formats they want to implement in place of Obama’s
                                policies in order to grant the same protection that Americans were getting before 2016.
                            </p>

                            <p><i>“I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble. I hope my
                                    grandkids grow up to be -- don’t listen to their parents, who all decided to do

                                    another one run a social organization for at-risk youth, you know.” - Joe Biden at a
                                    Brookings Institute Event in 2019
                                </i></p>

                            <p>Over the course of his campaign, Joe Biden has been smeared with labels ranging from
                                “communist” to “socialist” to “another Bernie Sanders”, yet his policies themselves
                                don’t paint that picture by any means. At face value, Biden’s policies clearly emphasize
                                reducing the struggle faced by the American middle class. Biden has stated multiple
                                times that the middle class is falling behind significantly while the number of
                                billionaires and rich people in America continue to grow and earn more. The issue with
                                his policies lie therein with how they would impact people’s taxes and the budget
                                deficit/national debt. </p>

                            <p>Since around 2010 (post recession), both the middle class and upper class median
                                household incomes have gone up. However, the disparity between the level of increase
                                both groups are experiencing is significant. According to The PEW Research Center the
                                median middle class income, “increased by 6% between 2010 and 2016—from $74,015 in 2010
                                to $78,442” while the upper class median income increased from “$172,152 to $187,872, an
                                overall gain of 9%,” indicating a significant disparity in growth. Furthermore, while
                                the median household income didn’t change from 2017 to 2018, the “number of people
                                without health insurance increased from 7.9%, or 25.6 million, in 2017 to 8.5%, or 27.5
                                million, in 2018,”. 2.1 million people became uninsured for healthcare within a single
                                year. These statistics are only a minute window into the middle class losing more and
                                more ground to America’s top 1%.
                            </p>

                            <p>Biden’s plan to address this can be split into impacts on 3 groups of Americans: those
                                making above $400k annually, large corporations, and the rest of the public.

                            <p>The first of Biden’s policies for the 400k plus group is to implement a 12.4% social
                                security payroll tax that would be evenly split between employees and employers. Next,
                                the individual income tax for people making more than 400k a year would be reverted to
                                the pre-Trump tax cut, to 39.6%. Under Donald Trump this number had been brought down to
                                37% through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He would also significantly reduce itemized and
                                business income deductions for anyone making above 400k annually. Essentially, if one is
                                making above $400,000 annually, there is no doubt that under Joe Biden, their annual
                                after-tax income would decrease a decent amount as estimates state that most people in
                                this income group will see a 6.5% decrease in this income measure. </p>

                            <p>Large corporations would also be slapped with an increase in the corporate tax rate, from
                                21% to 28%. Biden has proposed a minimum tax on any corporations making profits of $100
                                million or more and double the tax rate on foreign subsidiaries of US firms. These
                                policies would hike up taxes and lower profits for any corporation or firm making large
                                profits will see a significant increase in taxation and lower profits. However, Biden
                                does introduce benefits that would apply to certain large corporations and many small
                                businesses. He plans to reduce the tax liability of businesses experiencing layoffs or
                                large closures by establishing a Manufacturing Communities Tax Credit, which he would
                                expand to small businesses if they adopt workplace retirement savings plans. Biden also
                                proposes many renewable energy related tax credits that would reward carbon capture, use
                                and storage. He targets outsourcing among large corporations by imposing a new 10%
                                additional tax on corporations that outsource manufacturing and service jobs and by
                                establishing a 10% tax credit for “Made in America” activities in order to encourage
                                manufacturing and production in America instead through reestablishing closing/closed
                                facilities, or restarting manufacturing employment here. The validity of this policy
                                however, is unclear because tariffs under Trump were a more direct way to allow US
                                companies to decide how much they wanted to produce in respective foreign countries
                                rather than implementing a tax on all outsourced manufacturing services.
                            </p>

                            <p>While Biden’s economic policy would slightly negatively impact the $400,000+ group of
                                Americans, a sliver of the population doing extremely well, those making less would
                                benefit greatly through his policies. He is planning on expanding the Earned Income Tax
                                Credit for childless workers above the age of 65 and providing renewable energy tax
                                credits to all individuals. He wants to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit
                                to $8,000 in qualified expenses (originally $3,000) and $16,000 if multiple dependents
                                exist. He also plans on increasing the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 for any children 17 or
                                less and giving $600 bonus credit for kids under 6. Biden would also reestablish the
                                First Time Homebuyers Tax Credit which had been created during the Great Recession. This
                                would provide up to $15,000 for first time homebuyers. His healthcare plan would involve
                                expanding the ACA to cover 97% of Americans and would cost the country $750 billion
                                across 10 years. Additionally, the implementation of his environmental policies on
                                larger corporations could result in significant job growth and availability in the
                                renewable energy sector thus lowering unemployment.
                            </p>

                            <p>Although Joe Biden’s policies would negatively affect those making above $400k annually,
                                this group is less than 1% of Americans, making it questionable whether this impact
                                would harm the average middle class person at all. The effect of these policies on large
                                corporations is something that remains to be seen because while he does increase their
                                taxes, he does so in order to target outsourcing and promote renewable energy- arguably
                                laudable goals to have. Furthermore, he has specified a need to increase the minimum
                                wage to $15 which is a heavily questioned idea however, it promotes the logic that there
                                is no point in a decreasing unemployment rate if all of the people being employed are
                                barely making enough money to live on. Increasing minimum wage would allow for even
                                those making the lowest salaries in the country to have somewhat more of a safety net to
                                provide themselves with basic living needs. Raising the federal minimum wage also
                                stimulates consumer spending and reduces employee turnover. However, while the minimum
                                wage raise has its benefits, implementation could also result in an increase in prices
                                among sectors of the market and it could result in more layoffs as employers have
                                limited money to spend on salaries. Like the issues with other benefits he is planning
                                on directing at the American lower and middle class, the main question that lies with
                                Biden’s plan is what all of the changes he wants to implement will do to national levels
                                of economic productivity. Many predict that the Biden tax plan would reduce GDP on a
                                long term scale, while the effects of increasing corporate taxes on the state of
                                economic productivity can have mixed results in combination with his other policies.
                            </p>

                            <p>Both candidates have immensely different ideas of what would benefit the American economy
                                and its citizens the most. President Trump shows a clear interest in improving domestic
                                industries and the economy as a whole, perceiving that increased productivity as
                                translating into better job opportunities for all Americans. Former Vice President Joe
                                Biden focuses on taxing on the 1% of higher earning groups to benefit the average
                                American. Although an individual’s financial situation would skew their support for
                                either plan, voters must gauge their values with their ideal of overall economic health
                                to determine which economic perspective is optimal for America.
