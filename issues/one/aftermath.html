              <p>Race and its role as a factor in violence has been thrust into the forefront of the American psyche in
                the form of seething social media and widespread protests, demanding the government to respond to a
                moral imperative to stop perpetrating injustice against those of color. </p>

              <p>Over the past decade, black people being killed by the police have become staples of the American
                conscience in harrowing headlines, driving people to the streets and internet in outrage. George Floyd’s
                death has reinvigorated a movement transcending combating police brutality, instead aiming to purge all
                institutions of racism. In regards to racial violence, their narrative is that there is a war on black
                people, “all cops are bastards,” and the historical roots of police being racist are still fully intact-
                essentially, the primary perpetrator of violence towards people of color, especially black people, is
                racist law enforcement. </p>

              <p>In fact, the narrative of the police are at the front lines of a systemic, society-wide “war on blacks”
                is the direct cause for an increase in interracial violence in colored communities, ultimately amounting
                to more deaths in the very groups that the movement preaches to empower. In order to address the roots
                of violence that disproportionally harms people of color, the media-smeared reputation of law
                enforcement must first redeem itself through fundamental policy changes, so that they can be reinstated
                where in high crime areas where they’re needed the most.</p>

              <p>We should aim to change the way the role of police officer, or law enforcement, is presented to
                trainees and working officers. Despite 80% of interactions between police and citizens being nonviolent
                in nature, news reports and officers’ testimonies expose the unreasonably aggressive rhetoric that
                trainees are often imbued with- to view every person as a potential criminal or threat to themselves as
                officers and to the civilians around them, and to not hesitate in using force when danger was perceived
                as present- and the unreasonably scant training in deescalation. As a result, officers are often on the
                defensive, perpetually ready to escalate into aggression- not out of a desire for violence or conflict-
                but fear and impulse for self-preservation that has been amplified by training.</p>

              <p>The disparity of accountability between police and other occupations can be illustrated clearly: If a
                pilot is incompetent and crashes, that pilot is deemed incapable of his job and removed. Conversely,
                police get away with misconduct through a myriad of structures- ruthlessly protective police unions,
                Qualified Immunity, unwillingness of prosecution to prosecute due to their partnership with the police,
                and inadequate maintenance of misconduct records. A pilot union defending a member after they crashed a
                plane, or the unique circumstances of the crash preventing the crash from being seen as punishable,
                sounds ludicrous- yet that is how the police are treated. Almost 25% of police officers fired for
                misconduct were reinstated through clandestine maneuvers within the court and union, an alarming
                retention rate of individuals who proved themselves incompetent and dangerous.</p>

              <p>In terms of accountability and misguided training, the terrible stigma that has latched onto, and
                nowadays defined policing, is justified. Until officers are effectively and consistently penalized for
                wrongdoing and redefine their values in an officer to orient around problem-solving as opposed to an
                us-them mentality, the anti-police rhetoric will continue to cripple communities who need most policing.
              </p>

              <p>Two main characterizations of a high crime area is concentrated disadvantage (poverty, drugs, low
                education) and racial homogeneity, and more recently, broken relationships between police and their
                communities. Between 2014 and 2017, violent crime increased for the first time since 2005, predominantly
                in colored communities. An unmistakable factor in crime’s uptick in 2014 is increased media coverage,
                often accented with hysterics, of police brutality against black people. Overwhelmingly, colored
                communities lost their trust in the police, resulting in two things that increased violence there:
                first, not notifying police as frequently when crime occurs, leading to more unsolved or unregistered
                crimes; second, residents “taking matters into their own hands” through violence.</p>

              <p>In recent years, following publicized cases of police brutality, calls to 911 decreased across cities
                for about a year, especially in colored neighborhoods- even if crimes were occurring or increasing in
                these areas, and allowing this trend to continue. In 2015, following Ferguson, underpolicing in South
                Central neighborhoods in Los Angeles led to a “ghettoside” authority system, where gangs became loci of
                power and “no snitch” culture prevented crimes to be testified against or reported. Similar patterns can
                be seen in spikes in gang violence Chicago’s colored communities in 2016 after a period of decline, and
                the dramatic increase in unsolved murders corresponding with nationwide decline of trust in law
                enforcement. </p>

              <p>The past three months only confirm the causal effect between increased negative attention towards the
                police and widespread suffering and death among people of color. In Chicago, a city that is one third
                black and another third Hispanic, while overall crime decreased by 9%, murders spiked by 139% in July
                compared to July 2019, totalling 105 in that single month. In the first weekend alone, there were 79
                shootings, 15 of them fatal. Compared to the same time of year in 2019, shootings increased by 75%, from
                2019’s 232 to 2020’s 406 in the month of July alone. 573 people were victims of gunfire, with at least
                58 of them under the age of 18. The White House press secretary emphasized six children who were killed
                in Chicago, including Mekhi James (age 3), Sincere Gaston (age 1), and Natalia Wallace (age 7). These
                innocent lives were lost in frenzied criminality, enabled by police responding to public pressure in the
                name of curtailing racism against blacks- yet all these children were black and most likely killed by
                other black people, given that homicide is highest within a race and locality and Chicago has a high
                black population, relative to the rest of the country.</p>

              <p>Similarly, New York City’s shootings skyrocketed by 177% in July, amounting to 777 in total -
                surpassing the total of the entirely of 2019- and killing 54 as of August 2, accompanied by a decrease
                of robberies, assault, and rape. Teen Bronx basketball and academic star Brandon Hendricks and 1 year
                old Davell Gardner are just two of the more prominent casualties from recent violence.</p>

              <p>De Blasio hasn’t offered any concrete solution even as his streets grow slick with blood, blatantly
                denying the correlation between the dystopian escalation of gun violence and the disbanding of NYPD’s
                600-officer plain-clothed unit tasked with combatting gun crime. Even though gun arrests had been rising
                prior to June 15, they dropped 60% in the four weeks following the dissolution of the specialized unit
                and has spiraled into outright carnage beyond what longtime New Yorkers have seen, even through the
                1960s and 70s before Juliani’s tough on crime policies. De Blasio’s blind eye and the NYPD’s drastic
                decision has raised concerns from black leaders, who called on NYPD to bring back the plain-clothed unit
                as people died across the city, critiquing city officials for allowing such a rash change to be made. In
                fact, 81% of black Americans- the group that is supposedly the most unfairly victimized by law
                enforcement- want police to maintain or increase their presence in the communities.</p>

              <p>Perhaps the most blatant example of overzealous anti-police rhetoric occurred in Atlanta, where eight
                year old Secrorea Turner was shot by a BLM protestor at the same Wendy’s that Rayshard Brooks was
                killed. Mayor Keisha Bottoms stated “You can't blame this on police officers. It's about people who shot
                a baby in a car. We're doing each other more harm than any officer on this force." More simply and
                powerfully put in the words of Turner’s parents, “You killed your own this time.” </p>

              <p>Data, from the past several years, and particularly the past three months, indicates that renewed and
                often visceral attitudes towards policing, accusing them of structural racism, only hurts these very
                people of color. We must become educated about the nature of race's relationship with violence and think
                critically before we speak or act. Although it is tempting to view violence through only the lens of
                racism, the dire impacts of this stigma have to be considered on a deeper level to avoid overcorrection
                that leaves hundreds of dead bodies in its wake. </p>
