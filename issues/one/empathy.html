              <p>For the past five months, American society has been restrained from its normal level of social
                interaction, whether that be in the workplace, at school, or between families and friends who don’t live
                together. Simultaneously, the country, and the world, has been through momentous upheaval, with COVID-19
                exposing government incompetence or authoritarianism, civilians gathering in the streets to protest or
                riot against perceived injustices, supply chains and small businesses all but collapsing, human rights
                crises and chemical explosions demanding action. </p>

              <p>Now more than ever, without routinely engaging activities that necessitate focus away from our phones
                and computers, we are drowned in constant notifications of people being shot in the street, dying in
                hospitals, being discriminated against, facing homelessness and bankruptcy. As social creatures who view
                empathy as a virtue, humans (especially the youth with our volatile temperaments) feel obligated to
                constantly feel in response to everything- in the past few months, it’s more often than not outrage,
                sadness, disgust, despair. This impulse and these emotions are amplified by social media, a platform too
                accessible to have excuses to not participate in through sharing graphics, photographs,
                pseudo-manifestos, regarding how to, essentially, showcase caring the most. </p>

              <p> Let us get something clear from the beginning - these problems are hard, really hard. The mission of
                alleviating human suffering is next to impossible even when we have ample resources and everyone works
                on the same team. But we are nowhere near our best. While these problems are multi-faceted and have many
                causes, we at the Postpartisan believe that there is one plague above all else, a tumor metastasizing in
                the American and global soul, which most undermines our hopes of solving the great problems -</p>

              <p>This creates a saddening paradox- we’re expected to feel everything, since not feeling supposedly is a
                form of complacency or perpetuating injustice. Yet, we can’t do anything tangibly significant to
                mitigate inevitably media-hyperbolized deaths and suffering through racism, COVID19, economic ruin. So
                we are left to simply stew in the emotions of others and ourselves through a screen for days, weeks, now
                months on end, as the world continues on its apparent highway to hell. </p>

              <p><b>The prolonged digital nature of news consumption and activism leads to desensitization to the issues
                  we claim to care the most about, excarberating the exchange of negativity in the context of our
                  political and cultural discourse. </b></p>

              <p> Substantial research indicates that when people are exposed repeatedly to the same stimulus, their
                response decreases over time on a neurological basis, specifically in the magnitude of
                hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation (HPA), or our psychological and physical response to stress
                [1]. This process is named habituation. Habituation speeds up in proportion to the frequency of
                exposure, and causes us to generalize stress-inducing stimuli along with our diluted responses. As of
                2019, Americans check their phones an average of 63 times a day [2], with teens, the age demographic
                most likely participate in online activism, averaging over seven hours on their phones [3], so frequency
                of exposure is definitely over-fulfilled. As for generalization of stimuli, this can clearly be seen in
                the rise of tribalism and polarization skyrocketing steadily in the wake of social media, and even more
                so in the past few months of national unrest [4]. Disagreeing with someone in political matters almost
                always ends a conversation, straining or severing relationships. Language fractalizes into dichotomies
                between good and evil devoid of nuance (COVID19 justifies lengthy lockdowns and economic shutdown, or is
                unjustifiably exaggerated as a health threat); all cops are bastards, or they’re all pure-hearted
                heroes; demonstrations of all kinds are justified, or all protests are to be condemned for allowing
                violence; systemic racism is a fundamental factor in outcome or a victimhood myth, etc. Clearly, America
                today enables habituation to occur on a huge scale. </p>


              <p> Multiple studies support habituation as a response to exposure to media. A study where participants
                watched nine violent movie scenes and nine comedy scenes found that repeated exposure to violence
                reduces its psychological impact in the short term, and at a higher rate than desensitization to comedy
                [5]. Another study, focusing specifically on violence in the news and entertainment, using surveys from
                three regions of the US, found that heavy local news consumption correlates with a “blunted response to
                news stories regarding real-life violent events when individuals have low trait empathy” [6]. Research
                from the University of Michigan followed college students over 30 years and found a 40% decrease in
                empathetic capabilities during this span, with the sharpest decrease after 2000, when digital technology
                began to enter the mainstream American lifestyle. The researchers found that social media has caused us
                to understand one another less (we’re less able to communicate effectively through nonverbal cues, which
                comprises the majority of a message, and can’t understand other perspectives as well due to less
                exposure to them via echo chambers). The only exception to overall emotional dilution was anger, which
                increased in virality and magnitude through reactionism, tribalism, and the popularity of shame [7]. In
                addition, research indicates that negative emotions are more contagious than positive ones because
                they’re rooted in survival instincts to avoid potential threats by “catching” someone else’s fear [8].
              </p>


              <p>Our current state - ceaseless exposure to the news and our peers, dozens of contentious issues to
                divide us, physical isolation demanding compensation via increased digital interaction - is the perfect
                recipe for the hyperactive activist culture we see today, where caring for every single victim of
                supposed police brutality, COVID19, economic breakdown, is mandatory, or else silence is “violence” or a
                “privilege.” Yet this expectation is psychologically impossible and alarmingly damaging to society’s
                functionality.
              </p>

              <p> The idea of compassion fatigue was first coined by Charles Figley, a professor of psychology and
                family therapy, who described it as “we have not been directly exposed to the trauma scene, but we hear
                the story told with such intensity, or we hear similar stories so often, or we have the gift and curse
                of extreme empathy and we suffer...Eventually, we lose a certain spark of optimism, humor and hope. We
                tire. We aren’t sick, but we aren’t ourselves” [9]. This definition and concept was initially applied to
                caretakers and therapists in regards to becoming desensitized to trauma and tragedy through decades of
                hearing similarly weighty stories from their patients [10].
              </p>

              <p> Compassion fatigue has been studied extensively in professional health and human services, and
                repeatedly result in reduced performance, absenteeism, and intentions to leave their jobs. In charities
                and nonprofits, volunteer turnover is extremely high because of the nature of the job- low pay for self
                sacrifice, in the name of empathy. Empathy has been empirically proven to be finite: the more you
                allocate to Thing X, the less you have for Thing Y, and feeling obligated to designate equally for a
                myriad of things results in feelings of emotional drainage and burden. Empathy’s limits also result in
                preferential empathy to those we perceive as similar to us in belief and goals, enabling the
                underpinnings of an aggressive us-them mentality. Most importantly, Harvard Business Review cites
                studies that prove that empathy easily results in eroded morals, where “people are more inclined to
                cheat when it serves another person,” and “it only gets worse when they empathize with another’s plight
                or feel the pain of someone who is treated unfairly: In those cases, they’re even more likely to lie,
                cheat, or steal to benefit that person" [11].
              </p>

              <p> Empathy, when pushed to its limits, is finite, preferential, and self-rationalizing, all of which are
                negative. We can see all three in America today. Quarantine initially resulted in increased levels of
                anxiety and restlessness, before surrendering to depression and emotional exhaustion, with an underlying
                sense of having no control. More recently, two or three weeks after the George Floyd protests, graphics
                and articles began to circulate at higher rates regarding how to combat activism burnout, spelling out
                symptoms like lethargy, anger and hopelessness, feelings of shame and guilt for not being able to
                inspire significant change [12]. Although people were initially unified by denouncing the knee of
                Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes, once looting and violence began to be mixed in with protests,
                society began to fracture and radicalize, two distinct camps emerging of people who believe America is
                fundamentally racist and despicable, and those who believe America is a country built on good principles
                that it has been working steadily towards fulfilling since the Revolution, with racism as a declining
                role as a factor in achievement. People from perceived “oppressed” classes are automatically more
                credible and respected, as well as people who claim to be their “allies” by following constantly
                shifting standards of thinking and behavior, under the name of “anti-racism.”
              </p>

              <p>I think self-rationalization is the most dangerous dimension of empathy. This can be seen in the
                justification of violence against law enforcement and non-protestors [13], gatherings en masse via
                protests being acceptable but not for parties or religion [14], cancel culture’s spread [15], warping
                data about black on black crime and police brutality [16], unilaterally condemning all white people for
                more implicit bias than any other race, misleading headlines that gloss over Biden’s racist remarks or
                constantly point fingers at Trump [17], advocating for literal segregation and racial quotas in
                businesses [18], employment [19], and education at the expense of nonblacks and meritocracy [20],
                unraveling history and education on the basis of people like Abraham Lincoln [21] and the notion of 2+2
                = 4 being racist [22]. As irrational, extreme things like this become acceptable in the same of social
                justice and equality, that group gains the upper ground in the mainstream and effectively pushes any
                dissent onto the defensive and into a minority, especially as they purge themselves by constantly
                pushing the idea that whatever anyone is doing to combat racism is never enough [23]. </p>

              <p>Of course, empathy is a laudable social and neurological capability. It allows humans to strengthen our
                bonds with those around us, form connections with those who disagree with us through establishing other
                commonalities, and generally interact with people in a more positive and cooperative way. However, this
                great part of human nature is also the most vulnerable to exhaustion and perversion. </p>

              <p>I am deeply concerned for the future of this country if legitimately toxic and unrealistic expectations
                continue to dictate activism. Taking breaks from consuming media and posting responses to current events
                needs to be normalized as a biological need - instead of looked down upon as being lazy or apathetic -
                in order to prevent emotional deterioration, mistreatment of others, and illogical radicalization.
                Mantras like “silence is violence” and “in the age of information, ignorance is a choice” can’t be
                accepted anymore: they set people up for (1) failure to be adequate in their ability to recite the names
                of every perceived victim of racism, power-abusing police officer or politician, not-woke-enough public
                figure, and (2) compassion fatigue that takes a personal toll and damages a person’s relationships. </p>

              <p>Ideally, our reserves of empathy should be redirected towards bridging gaps rather than reinforcing
                in-group biases, so that more of our limited energy goes moving together towards a shared vision of
                progress, rather than retreating further into our respective ideological corners in a delusion of
                complete self righteousness. </p>

              <p> Finally - embrace nuance. There are no easy solutions - to quote the West Wing, no “ten word answers.”
                I’m sorry, but those posts you share on Instagram don’t come close to cutting it. No one camp has all
                the policies necessary to bring about utopia. There is a lot of data, unintended consequences, and
                imperfect information to consider - celebrate that. And above all, factor into your analysis the
                possibility that you could be wrong.</p>
