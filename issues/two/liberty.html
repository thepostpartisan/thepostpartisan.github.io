                            <p> Despite a slow return to normalcy, institutions are still falling apart, workers are
                                still losing their jobs, and education is still being reshaped as doctors, politicians,
                                and scientists still scramble for solutions. During a vital election year, all American
                                citizens have been asked an unprecedented question: should they gamble their safety to
                                exercise their right to vote? Does their single vote really matter?

                            </p>

                            <p>The answer is easy: yes. A matter of one vote can make a difference. The popular argument
                                here is that every vote combines to make an impact. However, while this is valid,
                                certain cases show that one vote in itself – without adding up with any other votes –
                                can truly determine an election. In fact, in 2018, Kentucky Representative Jim Glenn won
                                by one vote. Likewise, in 2002, Washington Representative Ed Mitchell won by merely one
                                vote. In the face of devastation caused by this pandemic, we must exercise our most
                                sacred right, and considering the current inadequacies of the USPS, voting in person or
                                dropping off a mail-in ballot at a local drop-box is the most viable option. In the
                                history of this nation, our right to vote alone has always been at the core of our
                                American democracy, and since our country’s founding, marginalized groups have had to
                                risk their lives to visit the polls. Today, we all have a common illness keeping us at
                                home. However, it is our duty to band together and vote.

                            </p>

                            <p> The representation we enjoy today was once a quiet fantasy. Colonial Americans began to
                                make this dream a reality when creating a nation built by and for the people. Colonists
                                were inspired by Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and his profound belief in the
                                right to life, liberty, and property.1 Thomas Jefferson modified this idea and declared
                                that the United States would preserve the unalienable rights of “Life, Liberty” and,
                                deliberately in place of property, “the pursuit of Happiness.2”

                            </p>

                            <p>For Jeffersonian Republicans, representation meant everyone shared in the power of the
                                government, and the only way to ensure this shared power was to expand the pool of
                                people eligible to elect those who would represent them on a federal level. Jefferson
                                worked to create universal white male suffrage by inspiring states to abolish property
                                requirements for voting. Although Jefferson was paradoxical – preaching “radically”
                                liberal ideas while owning over three-hundred slaves and inspiring Republican
                                Motherhood, which kept women out of the political sphere3 – he is proof that since the
                                foundation of our nation, one’s right to vote has been in direct correlation with their
                                pursuit of individual merriment.

                            </p>

                            <p>Those who were not included in the initial push for universal suffrage continued to echo
                                the belief that one’s personal satisfaction manifests itself in one’s right to vote.
                                “The power of the ballot we need in sheer defense, else what shall save us from a second
                                slavery?4” W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in the years following the Civil War. After the passing
                                of the 19th Amendment, Carrie Chapman Catt wrote “That vote has been costly. Prize it!
                                The vote is a power, a weapon of offense and defense, a prayer.5” Both knew the
                                struggles their predecessors underwent to grant them the power of voting.

                            </p>

                            <p>It was not until Black Americans were recognized as citizens that voting even became a
                                possibility. The issue of slavery plagued our nation for decades until the fervor of the
                                Civil War incited its collapse. With a Union victory in 1865, Republican leaders worked
                                to sew the nation back together; as an initial step, Congress passed the Thirteenth
                                Amendment, legally abolishing the abhorrent practice of explicitly enslaving
                                human-beings. However, despite the glamour of earnest change like the one brought about
                                shortly after the Thirteenth Amendment, one must recognize that basic rights such as
                                suffrage were not immediately granted after such landmark legislation. Even after the
                                Fourteenth Amendment, which “guaranteed” equal rights by recognizing every person in the
                                United States as a protected citizen, politicians found ways to evade the law, and the
                                Supreme Court often upheld oppression disguised as states’ rights. The Slaughterhouse
                                Cases were one such example, ruling that the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to
                                national citizenship rights, meaning states could continue to deny citizens the right to
                                vote through poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and other discriminatory practices. The
                                ruling also reinforced the continued denial of Native Americans’ right to vote – a right
                                only granted after the 1975 amendment to the Voting Rights Act.

                            </p>

                            <p> Similarly, cases such as U.S. V. Anthony and Minor V. Happersett explicitly denied women
                                the right to vote. Nevertheless, despite these barriers, the continued pressure of
                                suffragettes – starting with the Seneca Falls Convention, all the way until the passing
                                of the 19th Amendment – significantly changed the role of women in America. Early
                                activists challenged the Cult of Domesticity, arguing women, even if they choose to
                                complete domestic tasks, could become involved in politics. Since then, feminism has
                                transcended into an unstoppable force, and through sweat and tears women have achieved
                                their share of power.
                            </p>

                            <p> Today’s widespread coronavirus challenges universal suffrage similarly to how oppression
                                has challenged it in the past. As a country, we must take action, for voting is as
                                important – if not more important – today as it has been throughout every era of
                                American history. It is the one sliver of representation we are afforded; it is a right
                                generations of Americans have fought for us to have. Fundamentally, it ensures equal
                                power in our democracy, and with equal power comes an equal ability to pursue happiness.
                                Yet the term happiness is subjective, and unfortunately, unlike life and liberty, one’s
                                personal definition of happiness cannot always be guaranteed. However, through one’s
                                right to vote, one’s ability to demand and pursue the happiness they envision is
                                guaranteed. Today, the entire United States is in a deep pursuit of happiness, for the
                                country is both socially and economically depressed. Nevertheless, we will survive – and
                                to do so, we must remember our nation’s values. In pursuit of life, we must love. In
                                pursuit of liberty, we must breathe. In pursuit of happiness – we must vote.
